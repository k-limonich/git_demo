Block comments are used to provide descriptions of files, methods, data structures and
algorithms. Block comments should be used at the beginning of each file and before each
method. They can also be used in other places, such as within methods. Block comments inside
a function or method should be indented to the same level as the code they describe.
Short comments can appear on a single line indented to the level of the code that follows. If a
comment canâ€™t be written in a single line, it should follow the block comment format.
A single-line comment should be preceded by a blank line.
Very short comments can appear on the same line as the code they describe, but should be
shifted far enough to separate them from the statements. If more than one short comment
appears in a chunk of code, they should all be indented to the same tab setting. Avoid the
assembly language style of commenting every line of executable code with a trailing comment.
