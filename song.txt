Back home smoking legal (legal)
I got more slaps than The Beatles (Beatles)
Foreign shit runnin' on diesel, dawg
Playin' with my name, that shit is lethal, dawg (who you say you was?)

Don Corleone
Trust me, at the top it isn't lonely (strapped)
Everybody actin' like they know me, dawg
Don't just say you're down, you gotta show me (what you gotta do?)

Bring the clip back empty (it's empty)
You asked to see the boss, so they sent me, dawg (sent me, dawg)
I just broke her off with a ten-piece, dawg (ten-piece, dawg)
That ain't nothin', I'm just bein' friendly, dawg

It's just a lil' ten piece for her
Just to blow it in the mall, doesn't mean that we're involved
I just what? I just uh, put a Richard on the card
I ain't grow upâ€¦
